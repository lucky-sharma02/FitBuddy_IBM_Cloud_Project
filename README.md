## 📌 Problem Statement – Fitness Buddy

In today’s fast-paced world, many individuals struggle to maintain a healthy lifestyle due to a lack of personalized guidance, time constraints, and inconsistent motivation. Traditional fitness solutions often require expensive subscriptions, in-person consultations, or rigid schedules that don't adapt to personal preferences or daily routines.

There is a growing need for an accessible, friendly, and intelligent virtual assistant that can provide on-demand fitness advice, healthy lifestyle suggestions, and basic nutrition guidance — all tailored to individual needs and available at any time.

**Fitness Buddy** aims to solve this problem by offering a conversational, AI-powered health and fitness coach that can:

- 🏠 Recommend home workouts and routines based on user input  
- 💬 Provide motivational tips and daily fitness inspiration  
- 🥗 Suggest simple, nutritious meal ideas  
- 🔁 Encourage habit-building and consistency
